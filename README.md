# testing-starter-kit

QA Engineers and Developers now have a wide variety of free open source tools for testing websites and portals, but it can be a challenging task to find them all and make informed decision on what and how to use.

This is a collection of free open source software testing tools with some links on how to use them.

The scope of this particular list is limited to things that QA Automation Engineers, Software Development Engineers in Test (SDET), Web Developers, etc. are likely to find useful.

You can help by sending Pull Requests to add more tools and links to "how to use" instructions. Once I have a good set of links in this README file, I'll look into a better layout for the information and links.

We love all the free things out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It's a bit of a grey line sometimes so this is a bit opinionated - please do not be offended if I do not accept your contribution.
